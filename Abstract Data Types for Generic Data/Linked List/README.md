# Generic Linked List

[Linked List](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/linked_list_algorithms.htm) consists of an abstract and linear data structure whose main objective is to store elements of the same type in a list arranged discontinuously in memory. The most elementary concept used in all linked lists corresponds to the "node", a substructure responsible for containing two attributes: The information that will be placed in each element of the list and a pointer informing the memory address for the next node in the list.

In the specific implementation of this module, another structure will conventionally be created to encompass all the information necessary to perform the specific operations associated with each single linked list instance. Each structure will include:

* A <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to the first element of the linked list, denoted by "<span style="color:blue;">front</span>";

* A <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to the last element of the linked list, denoted by "<span style="color:red;">rear</span>";

* A 32-bit unsigned integer counter, which can represent values contained in the interval **0** to **4,294,967,295**, where the limits of this interval are inclusive;

* A <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to an external function whose purpose is to determine the display method of list elements. This parameter is optional; its absence does not prevent the basic functioning of the data structure, but it makes it impossible to display its elements. To do so, simply replace this parameter with a <span style="color:red;">null pointer</span> (<span style="color:red;">NULL</span>) during the instantiation of each linked list;

* A **mandatory**, non-null <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to an external comparison function. This function receives as parameters two <span style="color:green;">pointers</span> to list elements and is designed to perform two-by-two comparisons between elements. The function must return: A **negative** value (less than zero) if the first parameter is considered inferior to the second; **zero** if both given parameters are equal; a **positive** value (greater than zero) if the first parameter is considered superior to the second;

* A <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to an external function whose purpose is to implement a specific disposal method for each element in the list. This function receives as its only parameter a <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to the data type stored in the list and performs the release of dynamically allocated memory for the element. If it is not necessary to deallocate memory, this parameter can be replaced with a <span style="color:red;">null pointer</span> (<span style="color:red;">NULL</span>) during the instantiation of each linked list;

* A <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to an external function whose purpose is to produce completely independent replicas of each element contained in the list, that is, the function will perform a [deep copy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Deep_copy). The function's only parameter is a <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to the element to be copied, and it will return a <span style="color:green;">pointer</span> to the new copied element. It's only necessary if the structure of the elements stored in the list involves dynamic memory allocation, otherwise, the copy function parameter may be replaced with a <span style="color:red;">null pointer</span> (<span style="color:red;">NULL</span>).


## Visualization of the structures used in the linked lists:

```c
typedef struct GENERICLINKEDLISTNODE {
    gLinkedListDataPtr data;
    struct GENERICLINKEDLISTNODE* next;
} gLinkedListNode;

typedef struct {
    gLinkedListNode *front, *rear;
    uint32_t counter;
    impressFunctionGenLinkedList printF;
    compareFunctionGenLinkedList compareF;
    destroyFuntionGenLinkedList destroyF;
    deepcopyFunctionGenLinkedList deepcopyF;
} gLinkedList;
```

## The pre-existing basic operations contained in this module include:
* ***initgLinkedList*** : Initializes and returns a pointer to the newly initialized linked list.
* ***gLinkedListCopy*** : Creates copies and returns a pointer to the copy of a given linked list.
* ***gLinkedListAppend*** : Appends a new element to the end of the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListClear*** : Removes all elements contained in the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListDestroy*** : Completely destroys the linked list, freeing all dynamically allocated memory present in it.
* ***gLinkedListImpress*** : Displays on the terminal a visual representation of the elements contained in the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListInsert*** : Inserts a new element into the linked list, positioning it arbitrarily.
* ***gLinkedListRemove*** : Removes a specific element from the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListReverse*** : Reverses the ordering of the elements present in the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListIsEmpty*** : Informs whether the linked list is empty.
* ***gLinkedListIsEquals*** : Determine whether two linked lists are equal.
* ***gLinkedListSearch*** : Informs whether a given element is contained in the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListHasSameElements*** : Checks whether two linked lists have the same elements.
* ***gLinkedListShareSameElements*** : Checks whether two linked lists share the same elements.
* ***gLinkedListCount*** : Counts the number of occurrences of an element in the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListSize*** : Enumerates and informs the number of elements present in the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListGetBiggest*** : Returns the largest element present in the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListGetSmallest*** : Returns the smallest element present in the linked list.
* ***gLinkedListPop*** : Removes and returns the element located at the specified index within the linked list.


## Usage Instructions
To include this repository locally in your project directory, follow these steps:
1. Open your project folder in the terminal.
2. Type the following command and press enter:
<ul>
    <li><code>git clone https://github.com/JamesStewart314/C-Language-Codes.git</code></li>
</ul>

Now, if everything went as expected, this repository should be present locally on your computer. In this context, the hierarchical arrangement of directories present in your project should resemble something as illustrated in the following image:

</div>

Finally, to include the linked list functionalities in your project, open your code in an IDE and add, at the top of the file — preferably adjacent to the already existing inclusion directives — the relative path to the header file that contains the prototypes of the linked list functions of this module. In the example given above, the specific path to include the header file in the "MainCode.c" code would be:

```c
#include "./Abstract Data Types for Generic Data/Linked List/genLinkedList.h"
```

Thus, after including the header file in your code with the #include preprocessor directive, the IDE will recognize the functions, which will be available for your respective use.

It is worth mentioning that your project's compilation process must include not only the codes already planned, but also the file containing the implementations of the functions declared in the header file. All these implementations are present in the *genLinkedList.c* file, so it will be the new file attached to the compilation stage.

Here is an example, in the same context mentioned above, of how to compile the code "MainCode.c" using the GCC compiler, assuming that the Linked List module was included and used in the code:

```c
gcc MainCode.c "./Abstract Data Types for Generic Data/Linked List/genLinkedList.c" -o ExecutableProgram -I "./Abstract Data Types for Generic Data/Linked List/"
```

<div>
In the above command, we specified the following during the compilation process:

1. Main file: <code>MainCode.c</code> (there may be more than one C file in addition to this, depending on the project context).

2. Relative path to the module: <code>"./Abstract Data Types for Generic Data/Linked List/genLinkedList.c"</code>, which implements the linked list functionalities.

3. Flag for executable name: <code>-o ExecutableProgram</code>, which defines the name of the resulting file after compilation.

4. Flag for the header file directory: <code>-I "./Abstract Data Types for Generic Data/Linked List/"</code>, which indicates the directory containing the header file used.

</div>

For demonstration and clarification purposes, there will be comments adjacent to each function signature, briefly describing its behavior and purpose, contained in the header file (*genLinkedList.h*). Furthermore, there is also a **commented program** that uses the data structure created in this module, in order to resolve any remaining doubts regarding its use, showing it in practice.
