/*

For sake of convenience, I chose to consider in this code that the height of a 
leaf in any tree is defined as one. I fully recognize that this representation 
is inconsistent with reality, since the height of a leaf is, in fact, zero. 
However, this decision was made to improve the readability, understanding and 
maintainability of the code as a whole, which facilitates various calculations 
related to the procedures performed in the tree. I apologize in advance if this 
choice may partially impair the understanding of the algorithm. 

                     Thank you for your attention!
